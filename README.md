# Jōbr: The Place for Job Seekers

Jōbr is a website that improves the job search experience by allowing applicants to track the lifecycle of their search. To start, the 
focus will be on building out functionalities to track job portals, applications, and statuses. In the future, there may be additions
in the area of analytics and suggestions.

Jōbr is not yet hosted anywhere, but will be in the near future. Stay tuned!
